                        where this latest edition of our HTML and CSS book comes in. It integrates
                        the HTML5/CSS3 features that are widely implemented today with the classic

                        you're an experienced web developer who's been frustrated by the slow pace
                        and gaping holes in the other training you've tried...this book is for YOU.</p>

                    <p class="hidden">Since 2001, programmers have been using our core Java book to master
                        the skills they use every day in developing desktop and web applications.
                        Now, you can train yourself in Java by using the current edition of that book,
                        Murach's Java Programming. It’s the one core Java book we’ve seen that presents
                        object-oriented features in a way that's both understandable and useful in the
                        real world. And because no professional Java developer should miss out on the
                        productivity features that are built into today's free IDEs, this edition shows you
                        how to use NetBeans to create, compile, test, and run Java applications, right
                        from chapter 1.</p>
